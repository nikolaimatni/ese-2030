Our goal in this chapter is to remind you of what these things are, what they're for, and how they can be automated and scaled out using computer code.  We'll see that with a little bit of work, we can already start asking really interesting questions, and solving some really interesting problems from science, engineering, and economics!\n",

    "## Motivation: Why Linear Systems?\n",
    "At this point, you might be wondering why an entire semester is devoted to solving systems of linear equations: after all, the world isn't linear, and already saw how $y=mx + b$ works in high-school.  What more to it could there be?  Well here's a dirty little secret that ``big science'' doesn't want you to know: we (as mathematicians and engineers) only really know how to deal with linear systems, and so a typical approach to solving pretty much _anything_ is to take a complicated problem and hammer away at it until you've reduced things to solving systems of linear equations.  Now, these systems of linear equations might be very high-dimensional (involving thousands, millions, or even billions of parameters), and it may not be obvious how to get them, but they're there.  A completely non-exhaustive list of where systems of linear equations appear include [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input%E2%80%93output_model), [internet search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), [computational fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics), [circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws), and [robot motion planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation).  We'll see a few simplified examples of these applications next before diving into the technical meat of this lecture."

    "### Motivating Application 1: Robot Motion Planning\n",
    "Suppose that I have quadcopter drone equipped with a camera, and I want to _plan a path_ that brings my drone to three interesting things to photograph, for example, a waterfall, a cool rock, and a deer (for this example, we'll assume the deer isn't moving).  We'll assume that our drone is flying at the same elevation the whole time, meaning that its path evolves in the $(x,y)$ plane, as illustrated in [](#motion-plan).\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to _robot motion planning_ is to parameterize, that is describe, our drone's path in terms of a function.  Specifically, we can define our robots path as a function $p$ that ingests the current $x$-position of our robot, and outputs the corresponding $y$ position as $p(x)$.  For example, if we set $p(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2$, we are saying that our drone will follow a path $(x,p(x)$ that looks like a quadratic.  Let's stick with the quadratic parameterization for now, and think about how we might _design_ $p(x)$, that is to say pick the parameters $a_0,a_1,a_2$ so that our drone's path starts at our location, crosses the waterfall, cool rock, and then the deer.  This problem is known as _polynomial interpolation_, because we're trying to design a polynomial function (through our choice of $a_0,a_1,a_2$) that passes through, or interpolates between, a preset number of points.  It turns out, this can be posed as a system of linear equations!  We'll revisit this example later in the lecture, see how it can be reduced to solving a system of linear equations.  Later on in the class, we'll answer questions like how many points can a quadratic motion plan interpolate, what is the ``best'' path to pick if there are more than one that meet our requirements, and how to quickly construct new paths given an initial one.\n",

    "### Motivating Application 2: Network Flows\n",
    "This example is adapted from p. 53 of LAA.  Systems of linear equations arise naturally when scientists, engineers, or economists study the flow of some quantity through a network.  For instance, urban planners and traffic engineers monitor the pattern of traffic flow in a grid of city streets.  Electrical engineers calculate current flow through electrical circuits.  Economists analyze the distribution of product from manufacturers to consumers through a network of wholesalers and retailers.  Many modern networks lead to systems of equations involving hundreds, thousands, or even millions of variables and equations!\n",
    "\n",
    "A _network_ consists of a set of points called _nodes_ with lines or arcs called _edges_ that define connections between nodes.  The direction of flow in each edge is indicated by an arrow, with positive flows in the direction of the arrow, and negative flows in the opposite direction.  The flow amount or _rate_ is either specified (via a number) or is denoted by a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic assumption of network flow is that of _conservation of flow_, i.e., that the total flow into the network equals the total flow out of the network, and that the total flow into a node equals the total flout of the node.  This has a very clear practical meaning depending on the application.  For circuits, this is a restatement of Kirchoff's current law.  For traffic flow, this means that cars cannot spontaneously appear or disappear from the road.  For distribution networks, this means that no product is lost (or created) while it is being transported.\n",

    "Flow conservation at a node can be written as a linear equation. Here, flow is conserved when $x_1 + x_2 = 30$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, [](#netflow) shows 30 units of flowing ino a node through one incoming edge, and two outgoing edges with flows $x_1$ and $x_2$.  For flow to be _conserved_ here, we must have that $x_1 + x_2 = 30$.  In a similar fashion, we can write down linear equations that balance the flow entering and leaving each node.  The problem of network analysis is to determine the flow in each branch when only partial information (such as flow into and out of the network) is known.\n"
