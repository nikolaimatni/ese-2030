    "## Small Pivots Cause Numerical Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember then when linear algebra is applied in engineering, data science, economics, and scientific domains, it is done so using computers.  Computers store data using bits (0s and 1s), and as such have _limited precision_.  This means that computers have to eventually round off numbers, because they can't keep an infinite number of decimal points.  This matters because when the numbers you are working with span a very large range (i.e., some numbers are _very big_ and others are _very small_), then even very small rounding errors introduced by the limits of your computer can cause significant errors in your solutions.  Here we'll look at a simple example of such _numerical ill-conditionning_, and see that by being cognizant of these issues, we can find a work around.\n",

Well that's not too bad, we're only off by 0.1 in $y$.  But, if we proceed to solve for $x$ using this value of $y$, we get  $x \\approx -10$! This is a big problem! A small error in $y$, i.e,  0.1, produced a huge error in $x$! The problem is because of the small pivot $0.01$ at $(1,1)$. The small error in $y$ is scaled up when evaluating the first equation, where we have to divide the exression by the small pivot $0.01$. If we interchanged the rows so that the pivot is $1$ and proceed from there via Gaussian Elimination, the approximate solution is ${y \\approx 20.1, x \\approx 9.9}$, which is much more reasonable.\n",

    "Implementing the algorithms you learn in this class from scratch in NumPy is a great way to both gain a deeper understanding of the math and to practice your coding skills.  However, when applying these ideas in real word situations, it is usually better to use built-in functions: these typically have 100s, if not 1000s, of engineering hours behind them, and have been optimized for reliability, performance, and scalability.  In the code snippet below, we use the standard scientific computing package [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)'s built in `lu` implementation for the [LU-factorization (with pivots)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.lu.html).  Note that this implementation is slightly different than the one described in our notes, and instead computes $P, L, U$ such that $A = PLU$.  By the end of the next section on matrix inverses, you'll know how to relate this expression to the one we described above."
