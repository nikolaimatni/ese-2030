    "## We Like Triangular Matrices!\n",
    "A theme we've exploited so far is that if we have an upper triangular system of equations, i.e., if $U\\vv x = \\vv c$ for $U$ and upper triangular matrix, then finding a solution $\\vv x$ is easy via back substitution.  Hopefully you believe that a _lower_ triangular system of equations of the form $L\\vv x = \\vv c$ for $L$ a lower triangular matrix is also easy to solve via forward substitution.  This section starts with the following question:\n",

    "> Is it easy to solve a system of linear equations of the form $LU \\vv x = \\vv b$, where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix and $U$ is an upper triangular matrix?\n",

We'll defer that situation for a little bit still, and instead look at why we bothered with $LU$-factorizations to begin with!  Suppose we are interested in solving a system of linear equations $A\\vv x = \\vv b$, and we assume that $A$ is regular so that we can apply the algorithm above to compute an $LU$-facotrization of $A$, i.e., we find a lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$ so that $A=LU$.  Then our linear system becomes $LU\\vv x = \\vv b$.  \n",

With that strategy in mind, let's introduce a new intermediate variable $\\vv z = U \\vv x$.  Then we can find the solution to $LU\\vv x = \\vv b$ by solving\n",

We then move down a row, and solve $l_{21}y_1 + l_{22}y_2 = c_2$ by plugging in $y_1$ and solving for $y_2$.  We continue in this manner until we've solved for $\\vv y$. \n",

    "Below is a simple NumPy implementation of the $LU$-factorization algorithm that we described above.  Notice that it looks very similar to our code for Gaussian elimination, but that we are keeping track of the changes we made to reduce $A$ to $U$ within the matrix $L$.  Specifically, when we subtract `scalar` times row j from row i in the line `U[i, :] = U[i, :] - scalar*U[j, :]` to perform forward elimination, we adjust the corresponding (i,j) entry of $L$ to undo this action by setting `L[i, j] = scalar`.  You should be able to convince yourself that building $L$ this way gives the same answer as computing the product $L_k L_{k-1}\\cdots L_2 L_1$ of elementary inverse matrix operations."
