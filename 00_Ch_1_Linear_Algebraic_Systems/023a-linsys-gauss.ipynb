For a linear system $A\\vv x = \\vv b$, with $A$ an $m\\times n$ coefficient matrix, $\\vv x$ an $n \\times 1$ unknowns vector, and $\\vv b$ an $m \\times 1$ right hand side vector, we define the _augmented matrix_:\n",

The extra vertical line is just to remind us that the last column of this matrix plays a special role.  For example, the augmented matrix for our [example system](./021-linsys-gauss.ipynb#simple-linsys) is\n",

We have already done this with the $(2,1)$ entry in [](#pivot1).  To make the $(3,1)$ entry equal to zero, we subtract the first from from the last row, resulting in the augmented matrix\n",

The three nonzero entries on its diagonal, $1$, $2$, and $5/2$, including the last one in the $(3,3)$ slot, are the three pivots.  Once the system has been reduced to this triangular form, we can easily solve it via Back Substitution.\n",

We'll call a square matrix $A$ _regular_ if the algorithm successfully reduces it to the upper triangular form $U$ with all nonzero pivots on the diagonal.  If this fails to happen, i.e., if a pivot appearing on the diagonal is zero, then the matrix is not regular.  We then use the pivot row to make all entries lying in the column below the pivot equal to zero through elementary row operations.  The solution is then found by applying Back Substitution to the resulting system.  We present both of these algorithms in _pseudocode_ and _python code_ below.\n",
