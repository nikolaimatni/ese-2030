    "## What is network flow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Network flow models can be used to capture traffic flowing through a road network, water through a grid of pipes, or information flowing through the internet. In this section, we will use systems of linear equations to understand how to allocate flows (traffic, water, internet packets) across links (roads, pipes, network links) in order to meet demand (how much traffic must flow in and out of a network).  We'll also explore what happens when links are modified or deleted.\n",
    "<!-- try to answer questions about how much traffic or water moved through specific links in our network, and think about what would happen if we were to modify or delete those links. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "A key modeling assumption that we make is that flow is _conserved_, i.e., flows leaving a node have to equal flows leaving a node.  Here we use the term _node_ to describe where different links (roads, pipes, etc.) meet, i.e., nodes are where links intersect.  In the figure below, flow conservation means that $x_1+x_2 = 30$.  This is a very reasonable assumption: for example, if we're talking about road traffic, it means that all cars that enter a road network eventually leave it, and that no cars can spontaneously appear or disappear within the road network.  Similarly, if we're talking about internet traffic, it means that data can't appear out of thin air, that all data entering the network eventually leaves it, and that packets can't be dropped (this is not always true for internet traffic, but we definitely prefer it when no data is lost!).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Is this a reasonable assumption? In the case of cars, this means that the system starts with no cars, and that all of the cars that enter a system leave the system entirely, and do not stop at intersections. In the case of water pipes, it means that the pipes start dry, and that the pipes end dry. In the case of packets, it means we log all inflows and outflows, and that all of the packets -->\n",

This is fairly intuitive, and we'll use this law to create our system of equations.
