    "[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a standard scientific computing module in the Python programming language, and is widely used in the engineering, data science, and financial industries.  Throughout these notes, we will provide you with NumPy code snippets that implement the mathematical concepts we introduce.  The purpose of these are twofold.  First, you will have coding exercises on the problem sets, and these snippets give you examples of the syntax needed to implement concepts from class.  Second, they let you see the math \"come to life.\"  While we are starting with some pretty basic ideas now, we'll soon be able to do some really interesting things with a few lines of code.  A great way to get intuition about mathematical objects is to paly with them in code.  You can do this by clicking the button below[^button], which will launch an interactive version of this notebook where you can modify code to see what changes in the output.  You are _strongly encouraged_ to do this!\n",

Although technically not the same thing, we will treat the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $[c]$ and the scalar $c \\in \\R$ as a scalar,[^notation] that is to say as an ordinary number, so we will drop the brackets. _Scalar multiplication_ takes a scalar $c$ and an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ an computes the $m \\times n$ matrix $B = cA$ by multiplying each entry of $A$ by $c$.  For example:\n",

This leads to initially odd looking expressions with double brackets, and you might be wondering why can't I just write `np.ones(5,4)` instread of `np.ones((5,4))`.  The reason is that the first argument of these functions is a `shape` tuple, and so we need to group the size of the dimensions (in our case number of rows and number of columns) into a single \"object\": we do that by putting them within brackets.  So while `np.ones((5,4))` tells python to make me a 5 x 4 all ones matrix, `np.ones(5,4)` tells python to make me an all ones 1-d array with 5 entries, and specifies the second function argument (`dtype` in this case) to be set to 4.  This latter expression does not make sense, and so python will send an error.
