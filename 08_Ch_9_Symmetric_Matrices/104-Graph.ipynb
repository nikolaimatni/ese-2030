    "Many, but not all, of these problems can be posed as _consensus_ problems. In this case, we assume there are $n$ agents, with _each agent state_ $x_i(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ evolving according to the following differential equation:\n",

    "In many settings of interest, each agent is a computer that is trying to compute or estimate a shared value. This is a common model adopted in distributed optimization and learning (want to compute a shared prediction), sensor networks (compute a shared estimate), and opinion dynamics (compute shared opinion). In these settings, it makes sense to set the local dynamics function $f_i(x) = 0$, so that an agent's state is determined solely by interactions with its neighbors.
