    "Many applications in engineering involve coordinating groups of agents to behave in a desirable way. Examples abound in a wide range of areas:\n",

    "Many, but not all, of these problems can be posed as consensus problems. In this case, we assume there are $n$ agents, with each agent's state $x_i(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ evolving according to the following differential equation:\n",

    "    \\item the neighbor set $N_i$ of agent $i$ are those agents that are directly connected to agent $i$, as specified by a connection graph $G$ with nodes $i = 1,\\ldots,n$ corresponding to agents, and edges defining inter-agent communication.\n",
    "    \\item the coupling functions $u_i^j: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ define how the state of agent $j$ influences agent $i$'s dynamics, so that the collective state of the agents $x(t) := (x_1(t),\\ldots,x_n(t))$ converges to a desired goal state $x^*$.\n",
    "\\end{itemize}\n",
    "\n",
    "In many settings of interest, each agent is a regulator that is trying to regulate or estimate a shared value. This is a common model adopted in distributed optimization and learning applications (e.g., to compute an average of sensor measurements or estimate a parameter). In these settings, it makes sense to set the local dynamics function $f_i(x) = 0$, so that an agent's state is determined solely by interactions with its neighbors. Agent $i$'s dynamics then become\n",

    "A common goal for such systems is for all agents to converge to the same value, i.e., that eventually $x_1 = x_2 = \\cdots = x_n = m$, for some value $m$. If this happens, system (**) is said to achieve consensus with consensus value $m$.\n",

    "Studying the behavior of system (**) will require us to bring together all of the ideas that we've seen over the past few lectures on eigenvalues, dynamical systems, and spectral decomposition of symmetric matrices. We start with a summary of relevant facts from graph theory, which will help us model the flow of information in (**)."
