    "\n",
    "In each case, the model is used to describe an experiment or measurement that is performed many times in the same way. The outcome of an experiment can be one of several known possible outcomes, and importantly, the outcome of one experiment depends only on the experiment conducted immediately before it. Before introducing a formal model for Markov chains, let's look at an example.\n",

    ":::{prf:example} Weather Prediction\n",
    ":label: weather_eg\n",
    "Suppose you would like to predict the weather in your city. Looking at local weather records over the past 10 years, you notice that:\n",
    "1. If today is sunny, tomorrow is sunny 70% of the time and cloudy 30% of the time.\n",
    "2. If today is cloudy, tomorrow is cloudy 80% of the time and sunny 20% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose today is sunny. What is the _probability_$^{1}$ that the weather 8 days from now will also be sunny?\n",
    "\n",
    "$^{1}$ You will learn how to properly define probabilities in ESE 3010. For our purposes, you can think of it as confidences or likelihood. So saying that 8 days from now will be sunny with probability $60\\%$ is the same as saying that the weather 10 days from now is determined by flipping a biased coin that comes up \"sunny\" $60\\%$ of the time and \"cloudy\" 40% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formulate this problem mathematically, let's use $S(k)$ to denote the probability that day $k$ is sunny and $C(k)$ the probability that it is cloudy. If these are the only two possibilities, then the individual probabilities must sum to 1 (1 represents 100% likely, .5 50% likely, etc.): $S(k) + C(k) = 1$.\n",

    "For example, the [equation](#sun_cloud) says that if day $k$ was sunny, i.e., $S(k)=1$ and $C(k)=0$ there is a 70% chance day $k+1$ is too; similarly, if day $k$ was cloudy, i.e., $S(k)=0$ and $C(k)=1$, there is a 40% chance day $k+1$ is sunny.\n",

    "Now, given that today is sunny, i.e., that $S(0) = 1$ and $C(0) = 0$, what is the probability that 8 days from now is sunny? We can answer this easily by iterating the system $\\vv x(k+1) = P \\vv x(k)$ to compute $\\vv x(8)$!\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's try to understand why the convergence in [](#weather_eg) happens, and then we'll look at some interesting applications of Markov chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our starting point is a general definition of a _probability vector_.\n",
    ":::{prf:definition} Probability Vector\n",
    ":label: prob_vec_defn\n",
    "A vector $\\vv x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is called a _probability vector_ if $x_i \\geq 0$ for $i=1,\\ldots,n$ and $x_1 + \\ldots + x_n = 1$. We interpret $x_i$ as the probability (or likelihood) that the system is in state $i$.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a _Markov chain_ is given by the first order linear iterative system\n",

    "\\vv x(k+1) = P \\vv x(k)  \\quad (\\text{MC})\n",

    "whose initial state $\\vv x(0)$ is a probability vector. The entries of the _transition matrix_ $P$ must satisfy\n",

    "0 \\leq p_{ij} \\leq 1 \\  \\text{and} \\  p_{1j} + \\cdots + p_{nj} = 1.  \\quad (\\text{TM})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "for all $i,j=1,\\ldots,n$. The entry $p_{ij}$ is the _transition probability_ that the system will switch from state $j$ to state $i$. Because this covers all possible transitions, this means each column sums to 1. Under these conditions, we can guarantee that if $\\vv x(k)$ is a probability vector, so is $\\vv x(k+1) = P\\vv x(k)$. To see this, note that $\\vv 1^{\\top} P = \\bm \\vv 1^{\\top} \\vv  p_1 & \\cdots & 1^{\\top} \\vv p_n\\em = \\bm 1 & \\cdots & 1 \\em = \\vv 1^{\\top}$ so that $\\vv 1^{\\top} \\vv x(k+1) = \\vv 1^{\\top} P\\vv x(k) = \\vv 1^{\\top} \\vv x(k) = 1$. That $\\vv x(k+1)$ is entrywise non-negative follows from $P$ and $\\vv x(k)$ being entry-wise non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's investigate convergence properties. We first need to impose a very mild technical condition on the transition matrix $P$, namely we assume that it is _regular_.\n",

    "\n",
    "The long-term behavior of a Markov chain with regular transition matrix $P$ is governed by the _Perron-Frobenius_ theorem, which we state next. The proof is quite involved, so we won't cover it, but if you're curious, check out the end of ALA 9.3.\n",
