    "With basic matrix arithmetic operations in our toolkit, we will develop a systematic method for solving linear systems of equations.  For a linear system $A\\vv x = \\vv b$, with $A$ an $m\\times n$ coefficient matrix, $\\vv x$ an $n \\times 1$ unknowns vector, and $\\vv b$ an $m \\times 1$ right hand side vector, we define the _augmented matrix_:\n",

The extra vertical line is just to remind us that the last column of this matrix plays a special role.  For example, the augmented matrix for our [example system](./021-linsys-gauss.ipynb#simple-linsys) is\n",

    "Note that it is simple to go back and forth between the original linear system and the augmented matrix, but since operations on equations also affect their right-hand sides, it is convenient to keep track of everything together using the augmented matrix.\n",

    "For the time being, we will concentrate our efforst on linear systems that have the same number, $n$, of equations as unknowns.  The associated coefficient matrix $A$ is square of size $n \\times n$, and the corresponding augmented matrix $M = [ A \\, | \\, \\vv b]$ then has size $n \\times (n+1)$.\n",

    "We will call the $(1,1)$ entry of the coefficient matrix the _first pivot_.  The precise definition of a pivot will become clear as we continue, but one key requirement is that _a pivot must always be nonzero_.  Eliminating the first variable $x_1$ from the second and third equations is the same as making all of the matrix entries in the column below the pivot equal to zero.  We have already done this with the $(2,1)$ entry in [](#pivot1).  To make the $(3,1)$ entry equal to zero, we subtract the first from from the last row, resulting in the augmented matrix\n",

    "The corresponding linear system can be written as $U\\vv x = \\vv c$.  A special feature of this system is that the coefficient matrix $U$ is _upper triangular_[^upper], which means that all entries below the main diagonal are zero, i.e., $u_{ij}=0$ whenever $i>j$.  The three nonzero entries on its diagonal, $1$, $2$, and $5/2$, including the last one in the $(3,3)$ slot, are the three pivots.  Once the system has been reduced to this triangular form, we can easily solve it via Back Substitution.\n",

    "What we just described is an algorithm for solving a linear system of $n$ equations in $n$ unknowns, and is known as _regular Gaussian Elimination_.  We'll call a square matrix $A$ _regular_ if the algorithm successfully reduces it to the upper triangular form $U$ with all nonzero pivots on the diagonal.  If this fails to happen, i.e., if a pivot appearing on the diagonal is zero, then the matrix is not regular.  We then use the pivot row to make all entries lying in the column below the pivot equal to zero through elementary row operations.  The solution is then found by applying Back Substitution to the resulting system.  We'll summarize both of these algorithms in _pseudocode_ below.  Later, we'll see how to translate this pseudocode into actual Python code that can be run on a computer.\n",
