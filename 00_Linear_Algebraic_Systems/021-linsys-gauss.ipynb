An important property is that _equivalent systems have the same solutions._\n",

It is in what is called _triangular form_: the first equation depends on all three variables, the second only depends on the second and third variables, and the last equation involves only the last variable.  The process we went through of transforming the original system [](#simple-linsys) to the triangular system [](#simple-linsys2) is an example of _Forward Elimination_: we work our way down the equations, eliminating variables as we go.  Once a system is in triangular form, it can be straightforwardly solved by the method of _Back Substitution_.  As the name suggests, we work backwards, solving the last equation first, which requires that $x_3=1$.  We substitute the result back into the middle equation, which becomes $2x_2-1=3$, with solution $x_2=2$.  We finally substitute the two values $x_2=2$ and $x_3=1$ into the first equation, which becomes $x_1+5=2$, and so the solution to the triangular system [](#simple-linsys2) is\n",

We note that in this case, system [](#simple-linsys) has a unique, meaning one and only one, solution.  We'll understand why this is the case later in the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process was incredibly simple and intuitive: add equations together to eliminate ``downstairs'' variables until you have found an equivalent triangular system, which can then be readily solved via back substitution.  Amazingly, barring a few minor complications that can come up from time to time, this is essentially all there is to _Gaussian Elimination_.  This incredibly simple algorithm is also unbelievably important and powerful.  After a brief detour to remind ourselves about matrix and vector notation, we'll revisit Gaussian Elimination through the lens of _matrix factorization_, which will allow us to easily automate and scale out these ideas to systems with hundreds or even thousands of variables.
