    "The left-to-right order in matrix products is critical because $AB$ and $BA$ are usually not the same.  In fact, unless $A$ and $B$ are both square matrices, only one of $AB$ or $BA$ will even be defined.  Given what we've seen so far, this shouldn't be surprising: the columns of $AB$ are linear combinations of the columns of $A$, whereas the columns of $BA$ are constructed from the columns of $B$.  We emphasize the position of the factors in the product $AB$ by saying $A$ is _right-multiplied_ by $B$ or that $B$ is _left-multiplied_ by $A$.  If $AB=BA$, we say that $A$ and $B$ _commute_ with each other.\n",
