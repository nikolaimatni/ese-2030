We made two key observations about the model structure that allowed us to effectively apply the matrix chain rule to compute gradients $\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial x_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial x_L}$:\n",
    "\n",

Add to that the fact that the number of data points $N$ is often very large (order of millions in many settings), and we quickly run into some serious computational bottlenecks. And remember, this all just so we can run a single iteration of gradient descent. This may seem hopeless, but luckily, there is a very simple trick that lets us work around this problem: stochastic gradient descent."

This also explains why you may want to use a mini-batch $B$ to compute a better gradient estimate $(\\hat{G})$, as having more loss terms leads to a better approximation of the true gradient. The tradeoff here is that as $B$ becomes larger, computing $(\\hat{G})$ is more computationally demanding."
