    "A theme in mathematics is recognizing that seemingly unrelated settings, objects, or models, all share common properties.  By viewing them at the _right level of abstraction_, they can all be reasoned about together in the same way.  _This is a very powerful way of thinking!_  This chapter will introduce the abstract notion of a _vector space_ which unifies the seemignly disparate spaces of ordinary vectors, spaces of functions (such as polynomials, exponentials, and trigonometric functions), spaces of matrices, (infinite dimensional) linear operators (we will only briefly encounter these later in the course), and more under a common conceptual framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many of you, this will be your first foray into \"abstraction,\" and it will take some time and effort to get used to these ideas.  A good strategy is to make sure that you understand what the new concepts we introduce mean in the context of ordinary Euclidean space, and then work through how they might apply in more abstract spaces, like the space of polyomials, vector valued sampled signals over an interval, or symmetric matrices (yes, we will see that these are all examples of vector spaces!)."
