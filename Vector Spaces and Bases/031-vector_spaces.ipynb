    "In mathematics, we can view seemingly unrelated settings, objects and models at the right level of abstraction which enables us to reason them together in the same way. _Vector Space_ is an abstract notion which unifies a wide range of objects such as ordinary vectors, matrices, spaces of functions such as polynomials, exponentials, trigonometric functions, and inifinite dimensional linear operators. We recommend you to understand these new abstract concepts in the context of ordinary eucledian space such as three-dimensional space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$), and then think about applying to more abstract spaces such as polynomials, vector-valued signals, matrices.
