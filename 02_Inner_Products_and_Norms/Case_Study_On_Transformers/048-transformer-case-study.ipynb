    "## What are transformers?\n",
    "\n",

    "First, let's look at the archictecture itself. The Transformer was first proposed by Vaswani et. al. in [*Attention is all you need*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762v7). At the core of the transformer is the Attention Mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer was originally proposed to help with machine translation, to be able to translate large documents like books from one language to another. This is one of the core topics of study of Natural Language Processing or NLP. At the time the Transformer was developed, the state of the art approach was the [LSTM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735). Unfortunately when translating an entire book, these approaches were unable to keep context from earlier in the book, or even in a sentence. This presented challenges when translating from languages that flip the order of the verb and the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Translation Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for us to try operating on words, we need to find mathematical representations for them. The way that words are represented in Machine Translation is through vectors. An example word 'with' is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\text{with} \\mapsto\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0 \\\\\n",
    "1 \\\\\n",
    "0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can build dictionaries that consist of these vectors, and create a library of these keys $K$. We can also have a set of vectors that represent our target language, in a set of values $V$. For our example, $K$ can have a set of vectors that represent the meaning of some words, like 'with', 'above', and 'below'. If we are translating to french, we would use the corresponding words in French 'avec', 'au-dessus', 'ci-dessous'.\n"

    "## What does Attention do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention helps us relate words from our query $Q$, to a set of keys $K$, into a domain of values $V$. In the case we just described, if we query for the word 'with', this would match with the key for 'with' in the matrix $K$. Finally, this would match with the value $V$ for 'avec', which is the french translation of 'with'.\n",
