    "The diagonalization theorems we've seen for complete and symmetric matrices have played a role in many interesting applications. Unfortunately, not all matrices can be factored as $A = PDP^{-1}$ for a diagonal matrix $D$; for example such a factorization makes no sense if $A$ is not square! Fortunately, a factorization $A = P \\Delta Q^T$ is possible for any matrix $m \\times n$ matrix $A$!

    "Most numerical calculations that require solving a linear equation $Ax=b$ are as reliable as possible when the SVD of $A$ is used.

    "In particular, if some of singular values are much larger than others, this means certain directions are stretched out much more than others, which can lead to rounding errors.
