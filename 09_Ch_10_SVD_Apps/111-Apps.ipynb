    "The diagonalization theorems we've seen for complete and symmetric matrices have played a role in many interesting applications. Unfortunately, not all matrices can be diagonalized. As we've seen before, if $A$ is not square, even a factorization makes no sense. If $A$ is not square, fortunately a factorization $A = P \\Delta Q^T$ is possible for any matrix $A$. A special factorization of this type, called the singular value decomposition, is one of the most useful and widely applicable matrix factorizations in linear algebra.\n",

That is, the length of $Ax$ is maximized when $x = v_1$, and $\\|Av_1\\| = |\\lambda_1|$.}\n",
    "\n",
    "This description is reminiscent of the optimization principle we saw for characterizing eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, albeit with a focus on maximizing length $\\|Ax\\|$ rather than the quadratic form $x^T A x$. What we'll see next is that this description of $v_1$ and $|\\lambda_1|$ has an analogue for rectangular matrices that will lead to the singular value decomposition.\n",

If we consider the effects of this map on the unit sphere $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid \\|x\\| = 1\\}$, we observe that multiplication by $A$ transforms this sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ into an ellipse in $\\mathbb{R}^2$:\n",
