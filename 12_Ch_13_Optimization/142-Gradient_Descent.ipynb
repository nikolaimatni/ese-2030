    "Our intuition so far is that we should try to \"walk downhill\" and that the negative gradient $-\\nabla f(\\vv x)$ points in the direction of steepest descent at point $x$. Can we turn this into an algorithm for minimizing (at least locally) a cost function $f(x)$?\n",

    "\n",
    "Because we know that $\\nabla f(x^*)=0$ if $x^*$ is a local minima, we can use the norm of the gradient as a stopping criterion, e.g., if $||\\nabla f(x^{(k)})||_2 \\leq \\varepsilon$ for some small $\\varepsilon>0$, we stop updating our iterate because $x^{(k)}$ is \"close enough\" to $x^*$ (typical choice of $\\varepsilon$ are $10^{-7}$ or $10^{-6}$, depending on how precise of a solution is required).\n",
